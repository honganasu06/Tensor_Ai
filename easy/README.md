# 🏹 Wumpus World Navigator — Round 1 (Easy)

This repository contains my **Round 1 submission** for the AI Competition:  
**Wumpus World Navigator (A* Pathfinding Agent)**.

The goal is to implement a pathfinding agent using the A* algorithm to navigate a grid-based world containing hazards (obstacles) and find the optimal path from a start point to a goal point without errors.
